# Portfolio
I organized my previous works for the purpose of demonstration. 

Files in this repo:
- Adversarial Attack Paper: Research paper on Deep Learning and Adversarial Attack published as first author
- House Price Report: A report on my solution for Kaggle House Price prediction competition
- Trading Strategies: A presentation of trading strategies in pdf and their code in python (presented to Maroon Capital)

The code for Adversarial Attack paper can be found here: https://github.com/JerryChinaL/Yau-Science-Award-Banknote-Recognition-Code.git

Most of my code in Javascript and React are for work, so they are not published here.
