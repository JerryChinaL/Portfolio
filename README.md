I organized my previous works for the purpose of demonstration. Essentially, there are two papers, one on machine learning (adversarial attack), and another also on machine learning (house price prediction).

This is the Adversarial Attack paper's github repo: https://github.com/JerryChinaL/Yau-Science-Award-Banknote-Recognition-Code.git
