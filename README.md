# Portfolio
I organized my previous works for the purpose of demonstration. Essentially, there are two papers, one on machine learning (adversarial attack), and the other also on machine learning (house price prediction). The papers can be found in pdf format in this repo. After completing these two projects, I've gained experience in using advanced traditional machine learning networks in solving regression problems, and training convolutional neural networks (CNN) to solve graphical problems.
